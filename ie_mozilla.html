        <h2>Why Mozilla is Superior to Internet Explorer</h2>
        <p>For a number of important reasons, Mozilla Firefox is often considered better than Internet Explorer (IE). While Internet Explorer struggles with current standards, resulting in many compatibility issues, Firefox supports the most recent web standards (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), guaranteeing compatibility across websites. Compared to earlier versions of Internet Explorer, which were slower and less efficient, Firefox's fast JavaScript engine (Quantum) offers better page rendering and speed. Two of Firefox's strong security features include regular updates and Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP). However, malware deliberately targeted older versions of Internet Explorer because of their many security flaws. With features like tracking prevention and private browsing, Firefox places a high priority on user privacy. Internet Explorer didn't have strong privacy protections until far later versions. IE provided a less versatile experience due to its restricted support for extensions. While Internet Explorer was limited to Windows, Microsoft has now replaced it with the cross-platform Edge browser. While Firefox is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. Because Firefox is open-source, community contributions and transparency are permitted. With no community interaction, Internet Explorer was closed-source and proprietary. In 2022, Microsoft stopped supporting Internet Explorer, making it insecure. Regular security patches and upgrades are still applied to Firefox. IE has a more antiquated, less user-friendly look, whereas Firefox offers an updated, customisable interface. While IE's developer tools were weaker and more limited, Firefox offers powerful and modern developer tools. When compared to Internet Explorer, Firefox provides better speed, security, privacy, customisation, and support for standards. Since IE has discontinued, Firefox is still a popular option for web browsing.</p>
