        <p> The majority of computers in the 1940s and 1950s were standalone devices, but in the 1960s, computer networks began to take shape. 
            Computers can exchange information with one another through a computer network. In the 1960s, the Internet began as ARPANET. In 1969, the internet started with four computers connected to a network. 
            With a global reach, the internet is currently the biggest and most well-known computer network. Though considerably simpler, early iterations of the internet behaved and looked like the current one. 
            No formatting, no pictures, and no interaction were present in the plain text documents. An early method of file transfer over the internet was FTP (File Transfer Protocol). Users viewed listings of available papers, downloaded documents of interest, 
            and connected to servers using FTP tools. Tim Berners-Lee created a more practical method for computers to exchange files over the internet in the early 1990s while he was employed at the CERN research institute in Switzerland. Berners-Lee called his invention "the web" or the World Wide Web. 
            Three things were involved with the web. HTML files are text files that have links to other text files in them. A browser is a program used to view HTML files.
            The HTTP protocol is a collection of guidelines for sending HTML files between computers.Berners-Lee's idea of a vast network of internationally dispersed webpages connecting to one another led to the site's initial name, the World Wide Web, or WWW. A document that can be seen in a web browser is called a webpage or web page. A collection of related webpages are organized into a website. 
            A web server is a program that serves webpages to web browsers.
